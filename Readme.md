If you have ever had to visualise particle acceleration in an instructive, numerically accurate and visually appealing way that is also accessible as a still image on paper, a moving picture on screen or an interactive experience on smartphones and desktop computers, your options have been limited. With Pathicles, there might be a solution for you.

A **pathicle** is the visualization of the motion of a particle by sampling this trajectory in equidistant time steps. **Pathicles** is an open source project for creating those pathicles in a web browser by unleashing the parallel computational power of the available graphics processing unit in your device to solve the relativistic equations of motion numerically.
